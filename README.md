### Notable Projects
#### 1. [InvisionSync](https://github.com/ReckerXF/InvisionSync)
![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=csharp&logoColor=white1)

InvisionSync is an addon for the GTA 5 modification framework FiveM which allows server owners to synchronize their permissions from their Invision Community forum software to the server itself. As an example, someone who holds an Admin rank on the forum may receive an admin rank in game. The addon utilizes the Invision Community REST API to check the individual's forum group based on the profile field "Steam Hex" and sets their in-game permissions accordingly. InvisionSync is completely free and open sourced, allowing anyone to make modifications as they please.

#### 2. [TS3 Queue Bot](https://github.com/ReckerXF/ts3-queue-bot)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) ![Redis](https://img.shields.io/badge/redis-%23DD0031.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=redis&logoColor=white)

The Teamspeak 3 Queue Bot was originally a private project for an online gaming community. The purpose of this teamspeak bot is to queue users to join a channel that is already full. The bot features an assortment of features including the ability to exclude people in the channel from the queue based on their servergroups, and also offers the ability for those whose teamspeak clients crash to rejoin the queue (AKA a "recovery" option). The queue bot utilizes Redis for caching and storing data. While the queue bot is open sourced, it is **unmaintained** at this time and there may be errors upon running the bot for the first time.

#### 3. [PingStrike](https://github.com/ReckerXF/PingStrike)
![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=csharp&logoColor=white1)

PingStrike is a simple FiveM resource that check player pings every so often and assigns them strikes. After a certain amount of strikes received, the player is kicked for high ping usage!
